        "prompt": "Generate me a prompt with this twitter post in mind. Modify it for an advertisement for a Japanese language learning app called Chatomo where you learn to speak Japanese through conversation with an AI language partner of your choosing or that you made. Ensure we involve some Japanese language in the mix to teach viewers. Give the character an energetic and forward personality that garners attention from their voice and actions.\n\nThis is going to be a step by step breakdown on how to make longform AI videos that LOOK and SOUND realistic…\nSo you can push out crazy amounts of realistic ads & content for your business.\nI'd highly recommend reading this till the end because where this article gets really valuable is how we ensure consistent pacing & natural audio across the entire video… which to me is the biggest telltale of whether a video is AI or not.\n(Note: this is focused on making talking head/UGC type videos)\nStep 1: Make The Base Image\nThe base image includes two things:\nThe character that will be speaking in the video\nThe setting of the video\nTo do this we'll be using Nano Banana Pro. You can access it pretty cheap through tools like Higgsfield or Freepik.\nNow here's the thing most people get wrong…\nThe issue with a lot of AI videos is they look too perfect. Too clean. They all have like mannequin-look.\nWhich makes it super obvious it's AI.\nSo when you're prompting for your base image… yes you want to describe the character & setting… but it's just as important to include imperfections.\nI'm talking micro-pores, natural oils, fine lines… the shit people actually have on their skin.\nAnd make sure there's no studio lighting. We don't want this looking too professional. We want it to feel like someone just hit record on their phone.\nHere's an example prompt I use:\nA vertical 9:16 UGC-style video frame captured on an iPhone 11 resting on a tripod. The composition is a medium-wide portrait, framed at true eye-level with a slightly forward-leaning posture for conversational authority. A man in his early 40s with a youthful, Mediterranean complexion—olive-toned skin, deep-set dark brown eyes beneath strong, naturally thick brows, and a prominent aquiline nose with a subtle Roman bridge. His jawline is angular and well-defined, dusted with 2-day dark stubble that thickens slightly at the chin. Dark, almost black hair is thick and slightly tousled, with textured fringe sweeping across his forehead in casual disarray. Expression is warm and engaged—a genuine, broad smile revealing straight teeth with natural slight imperfections, a hint of gum line visible, laugh lines crinkling at the outer corners of his eyes. He wears a fitted black henley, collar slightly askew. Skin texture shows visible pores across the T-zone, faint smile lines deepened by the expression, and natural oils catching light on the forehead and nose.\n\nIn the immediate foreground: his hands rest naturally on the oak desk surface, fingers relaxed and slightly interlaced, visible veins and knuckle texture catching the light, a simple watch on his left wrist. Nearby sits a half-empty water bottle, wireless earbuds case, and a notebook with a pen—NOT heavily blurred, just a mild iPhone-style computational depth gradient suggesting nearness. The hands and forearms occupy the lower third of the frame naturally.\n\nCamera behavior uses the native iPhone 11 lens (26mm equivalent): slightly wide, honest perspective, mild barrel softness at edges, minimal compression. The background remains mostly sharp: a dark wood bookcase filled with hardcovers and a few framed photos is clearly readable to the left; a black Peloton bike with its red accent screen sits in the corner to the right, identifiable down to the handlebar grips. Only tiny pockets of neural blur appear around hair edges and the watch face—true iPhone depth-map artifacts.\nLighting is \"Available Light\": a mix of cool overcast daylight filtering through a large window from the left and warm tungsten from a brass desk lamp on the right, creating imperfect balance and natural falloff. Shadows are soft but asymmetric, with slight warmth pooling under the cheekbones and cooler tones washing across the white wall behind the bookcase. ISO noise from 500–900 sits naturally in midtones, producing sensor grain and mild vignetting (12% falloff).\nSkin is rendered with natural texture: visible micro pores across the nose and cheeks, faint peach fuzz catching sidelight along the jawline, subtle stubble shadow density variation, and soft lip line diffusion. Natural oils break through on the forehead and nose bridge; no foundation, no filter. Faint dark circles sit under the eyes—realistic, lived-in. Teeth show natural enamel texture with minor tonal variation, not bleached-white perfection.\n\nReality details: gentle 35mm film grain, light fingerprint smudge on lens glass, tiny dust haze in the air, and minimal chromatic aberration around high-contrast edges where the black shirt meets the bright wall. No cinematic bloom, no studio finish. The entire image should feel candid, trustworthy, conversational, and truly user-generated—like a high-performing coaching or sales UGC testimonial.\n\nStyling Overlay: raw UGC realism, available indoor light, mixed color temperature, minimal depth blur, slight lens smudge, visible ISO noise, no cinematic polish, emphasis on authenticity and true iPhone capture.\nOnce you've generated the image with Nano Banana Pro… throw it through Enhancor AI. It's an upscaling tool that adds even more realistic texture to the character.\nStep 2: Generate The Video\nAt this point you should have your script & your base image ready.\nNow we generate the actual video.\nI personally like Kling 2.6 the most… but Veo 3.1 is really good for this too.\nBut here's the problem…\nIf you have a script that's 60+ seconds long… video generation models like Kling & Veo only allow 10 seconds per generation.\nAnd yeah… we made a base image we can use as a reference frame to keep character consistency across all the clips.\nBut it's not that simple.\nYou can't just generate a bunch of clips & splice them together.\nBecause the pacing will be different across all of them.\nThe Pacing Problem (And How To Fix It)\nThe thing I hate about most AI generated videos is the pacing of the character just often feels too robotic...\nAnd it's tough.\nBecause if you put too little of a script in a single video generation call… the character speaks too slow. Even if you tell it to speed up… it messes up half the time.\nIf you put too much of the script… the character speaks way too fast.\nYou have to find the sweet spot.\nAnd what I've found to be the perfect pacing is 55-60 syllables per generation call.\nSo what you do is break your script into chunks of 55-60 syllables each.\nBut don't cut the script off mid-sentence... you want to break it by full sentences or else it'll sound unnatural af. \nAnd if you get to a point where you're at like 40 syllables & the next sentence would push you to 75… just add a short filler sentence to get you to 60.\nThis way every single clip has the same pacing. And when you splice them all together the character sounds consistent throughout the whole video.\nMaking The Character Feel Real\nNow let's talk about making the character actually feel human.\nThe problem with most AI talking head videos is the character is way too still.\nThink about when you record a selfie video or even something on your webcam…\nThere's natural spinal movement. Micro sways. Side to side. Back & forth. Shit you don't even notice you're doing.\nYour hands move. Your head moves. Not huge exaggerated movements… but subtle shifts while staying in roughly the same resting position.\nThat's what makes it feel real.\nSo in your video generation prompt… you need to include this stuff.\nHere's an example prompt I use that you can model off of:\nHand \"Home Base\" Protocol: Hands default to a relaxed but alive position (Active Idle). Fingers shift, thumbs rub, or wrists rotate slightly while anchored. Gestures occur only to emphasize key moments.\n\n[Action]: [0.0s-0.5s] [Simultaneous Cluster: Sharp Inhale + Eyes lock instantly to lens + Head is still (Pre-roll Buffer)]\n\n[0.5s-3.0s] [Simultaneous Cluster: [Hands in Active Idle (fingers interlocked, tight grip, thumbs pressing down)] + [Head tilts slightly right] + [Brows furrow slightly in seriousness]]\n\n[3.0s-6.0s] [Simultaneous Cluster: [Hands break clasp for a quick, contained open-palm rotation then return to base] + [Head drifts forward] + [Natural blink]]\n\n[6.0s-8.0s] [Simultaneous Cluster: [Hands return to Active Idle (loose clasp, thumbs tapping)] + [Head nods encouragingly] + [Cheeks lift in a natural smile]]\n\n[8.0s-10.0s] [Simultaneous Cluster: [Hands anchored (wrist shifts position)] + [Chin lifts in a quick, final nod] + [Natural blink]]\n\n[Script & Tonality]: (Tone: Urgent, Scarcity-driven, Serious) \"We only have 20 spots available because of our trainer capacity, and they fill up extremely fast.\" (Tone: Directive, Warm, Expectant) \"So click the button below, and I can't wait to see you in the gym.\" (Tone: Rapid, Final, Clean) \"and that is it for today.\"\n\n[Mood and Audio Pacing]: Rapid fire delivery, high energy, viral UGC style, confident, speaks fast the pacing [audio] should be at 2x speed\nNotice here in the prompt how I define the natural, subtle actions that the character should do at specific intervals throughout the video. \nPost-Production\nAt this point you've got all your clips generated.\nNow you wanna oad them into CapCut, put them all together and splice out any filler sentences or awkward pauses so it flows smoothly.\nNow there's two things I always do in post…\nFixing The Voice\nTo me the biggest telltale with AI is how shitty the voices sound.\nYeah people say use ElevenLab… but 11Labs sounds too studio-like.\nRemember just like with the images & videos… we don't want it sounding too nice. Because when you actually record yourself it's never that polished.\nOption 1: Adobe Podcast\nThis is the bare minimum. It's an audio cleaning tool & it does wonders.\nIf you've ever listened to raw Sora audio on mobile… it sounds terrible. But throw it through Adobe Podcast & it cleans that shit up so well it's insane.\nIt's super cheap and easy. Like I would do this at the absolute bare minimum.\nOption 2: Resemble AI (shoutout @Mho_23 for posting about this one)\nThis is a voice changer tool similar to Eleven Labs but it sounds way more natural in my opinion.\nIf you want to actually swap out the voice & make it sound legit… Resemble AI is what I'd recommend.\nCovering The Jump Cuts\nWhen you splice all these clips together you're going to have natural jump cuts. That's just how it is when you're stitching 8-10 second clips together.\nThe fix is simply is just use B-roll or animations over it\nOnce you have that in place & the pacing is smooth & the audio sounds legit…\nThe videos look so good & feel so realistic it's so sick.\nIf you want more AI sauce, sign up for my newsletter: https://tyler-vu.kit.com/main\nSide note there is also an AI tool called infinitetalk that people are using to make long form talking head AI videos\nMy only gripe against it is the pacing I don't have as much control over it as I do with the syllable method bc there's no timer with that tool at least of right now where I can say give me a 60s video... \nIt's more so like hey here's the image and the prompt and they just charge you credits by how long the video takes.

        "inputContext": "Give me back only the dialogue and nothing else. The purpose of this is to create a chunked dialogue. So no directions, no explaining the style, no queues or anything like that. Just straight up dialogue to be chunked out. Do not give me a response explaining anything, simple give me the words that are meant to be spoken\n\nIMPORTANT DIALOGUE RULES:\n  - DO NOT EXCEED 36 syllables per chunk\n  - GIVE EXACTLY 5 chunks with a clear beginning video dialogue that does not trigger a transition for the first chunk and clear ending video dialogue telling the user to download the app for the last chunk\n  - Mention the app name vs using a textbook or flashcard style app like DuoLingo at the second chunk  \n- Never use phrases that sound like segment beginnings\n- Never use phrases that sound like segment endings\n- Write as if the speaker is mid-conversation, not starting or ending a lesson\n- Avoid instructional/teacher language - sound like a friend sharing, not a teacher lecturing\n- No call-to-action phrases within the dialogue (save those for captions/overlays or the last chunk)\n- Each sentence should flow naturally into the next without feeling like a \"moment\" or \"beat\"\n\n  BAD examples (trigger transitions):\n  - \"Let's learn a useful phrase\"\n  - \"Repeat it with me\"\n  - \"Now here's the important part\"\n  - \"And that's how you do it\"\n\n  GOOD examples (continuous speech):\n  - \"A useful phrase is...\"\n  - \"Try saying it: ...\"\n  - \"The interesting thing is...\"\n  - \"Which brings us to...\"\n\nThe purpose is to generate a prompt that won't signal a video transition of any kind as this is a talking head video and we want it to be a single segment.\n\nMake it fun and powerful, don't be shy about being silly or energetic.\n\nGive me back only the dialogue and nothing else. The purpose of this is to create a chunked dialogue for video generation.\n\n  CRITICAL: Avoid any phrases that sound like beginnings or endings of segments. No \"Let's learn\", \"Repeat after me\", \"That's all for now\", etc. Write as continuous mid-conversation speech that flows naturally. Each chunk should feel like it could be in the middle of a longer conversation, never a clear intro or outro.\n\nNo directions, no style explanations, no stage queues. Just the spoken words, written to flow continuously without natural \"break points\" that video AI might interpret as transitions.\n",

        "inputPrompt": "Generate me a prompt with this twitter post in mind. Modify it for an advertisement for a Japanese language learning app called Chatomo where you learn to speak Japanese through conversation with an AI language partner of your choosing or that you made. Ensure we involve some Japanese language in the mix to teach viewers. Give the character an energetic and forward personality that garners attention from their voice and actions.\n\nThis is going to be a step by step breakdown on how to make longform AI videos that LOOK and SOUND realistic…\nSo you can push out crazy amounts of realistic ads & content for your business.\nI'd highly recommend reading this till the end because where this article gets really valuable is how we ensure consistent pacing & natural audio across the entire video… which to me is the biggest telltale of whether a video is AI or not.\n(Note: this is focused on making talking head/UGC type videos)\nStep 1: Make The Base Image\nThe base image includes two things:\nThe character that will be speaking in the video\nThe setting of the video\nTo do this we'll be using Nano Banana Pro. You can access it pretty cheap through tools like Higgsfield or Freepik.\nNow here's the thing most people get wrong…\nThe issue with a lot of AI videos is they look too perfect. Too clean. They all have like mannequin-look.\nWhich makes it super obvious it's AI.\nSo when you're prompting for your base image… yes you want to describe the character & setting… but it's just as important to include imperfections.\nI'm talking micro-pores, natural oils, fine lines… the shit people actually have on their skin.\nAnd make sure there's no studio lighting. We don't want this looking too professional. We want it to feel like someone just hit record on their phone.\nHere's an example prompt I use:\nA vertical 9:16 UGC-style video frame captured on an iPhone 11 resting on a tripod. The composition is a medium-wide portrait, framed at true eye-level with a slightly forward-leaning posture for conversational authority. A man in his early 40s with a youthful, Mediterranean complexion—olive-toned skin, deep-set dark brown eyes beneath strong, naturally thick brows, and a prominent aquiline nose with a subtle Roman bridge. His jawline is angular and well-defined, dusted with 2-day dark stubble that thickens slightly at the chin. Dark, almost black hair is thick and slightly tousled, with textured fringe sweeping across his forehead in casual disarray. Expression is warm and engaged—a genuine, broad smile revealing straight teeth with natural slight imperfections, a hint of gum line visible, laugh lines crinkling at the outer corners of his eyes. He wears a fitted black henley, collar slightly askew. Skin texture shows visible pores across the T-zone, faint smile lines deepened by the expression, and natural oils catching light on the forehead and nose.\n\nIn the immediate foreground: his hands rest naturally on the oak desk surface, fingers relaxed and slightly interlaced, visible veins and knuckle texture catching the light, a simple watch on his left wrist. Nearby sits a half-empty water bottle, wireless earbuds case, and a notebook with a pen—NOT heavily blurred, just a mild iPhone-style computational depth gradient suggesting nearness. The hands and forearms occupy the lower third of the frame naturally.\n\nCamera behavior uses the native iPhone 11 lens (26mm equivalent): slightly wide, honest perspective, mild barrel softness at edges, minimal compression. The background remains mostly sharp: a dark wood bookcase filled with hardcovers and a few framed photos is clearly readable to the left; a black Peloton bike with its red accent screen sits in the corner to the right, identifiable down to the handlebar grips. Only tiny pockets of neural blur appear around hair edges and the watch face—true iPhone depth-map artifacts.\nLighting is \"Available Light\": a mix of cool overcast daylight filtering through a large window from the left and warm tungsten from a brass desk lamp on the right, creating imperfect balance and natural falloff. Shadows are soft but asymmetric, with slight warmth pooling under the cheekbones and cooler tones washing across the white wall behind the bookcase. ISO noise from 500–900 sits naturally in midtones, producing sensor grain and mild vignetting (12% falloff).\nSkin is rendered with natural texture: visible micro pores across the nose and cheeks, faint peach fuzz catching sidelight along the jawline, subtle stubble shadow density variation, and soft lip line diffusion. Natural oils break through on the forehead and nose bridge; no foundation, no filter. Faint dark circles sit under the eyes—realistic, lived-in. Teeth show natural enamel texture with minor tonal variation, not bleached-white perfection.\n\nReality details: gentle 35mm film grain, light fingerprint smudge on lens glass, tiny dust haze in the air, and minimal chromatic aberration around high-contrast edges where the black shirt meets the bright wall. No cinematic bloom, no studio finish. The entire image should feel candid, trustworthy, conversational, and truly user-generated—like a high-performing coaching or sales UGC testimonial.\n\nStyling Overlay: raw UGC realism, available indoor light, mixed color temperature, minimal depth blur, slight lens smudge, visible ISO noise, no cinematic polish, emphasis on authenticity and true iPhone capture.\nOnce you've generated the image with Nano Banana Pro… throw it through Enhancor AI. It's an upscaling tool that adds even more realistic texture to the character.\nStep 2: Generate The Video\nAt this point you should have your script & your base image ready.\nNow we generate the actual video.\nI personally like Kling 2.6 the most… but Veo 3.1 is really good for this too.\nBut here's the problem…\nIf you have a script that's 60+ seconds long… video generation models like Kling & Veo only allow 10 seconds per generation.\nAnd yeah… we made a base image we can use as a reference frame to keep character consistency across all the clips.\nBut it's not that simple.\nYou can't just generate a bunch of clips & splice them together.\nBecause the pacing will be different across all of them.\nThe Pacing Problem (And How To Fix It)\nThe thing I hate about most AI generated videos is the pacing of the character just often feels too robotic...\nAnd it's tough.\nBecause if you put too little of a script in a single video generation call… the character speaks too slow. Even if you tell it to speed up… it messes up half the time.\nIf you put too much of the script… the character speaks way too fast.\nYou have to find the sweet spot.\nAnd what I've found to be the perfect pacing is 55-60 syllables per generation call.\nSo what you do is break your script into chunks of 55-60 syllables each.\nBut don't cut the script off mid-sentence... you want to break it by full sentences or else it'll sound unnatural af. \nAnd if you get to a point where you're at like 40 syllables & the next sentence would push you to 75… just add a short filler sentence to get you to 60.\nThis way every single clip has the same pacing. And when you splice them all together the character sounds consistent throughout the whole video.\nMaking The Character Feel Real\nNow let's talk about making the character actually feel human.\nThe problem with most AI talking head videos is the character is way too still.\nThink about when you record a selfie video or even something on your webcam…\nThere's natural spinal movement. Micro sways. Side to side. Back & forth. Shit you don't even notice you're doing.\nYour hands move. Your head moves. Not huge exaggerated movements… but subtle shifts while staying in roughly the same resting position.\nThat's what makes it feel real.\nSo in your video generation prompt… you need to include this stuff.\nHere's an example prompt I use that you can model off of:\nHand \"Home Base\" Protocol: Hands default to a relaxed but alive position (Active Idle). Fingers shift, thumbs rub, or wrists rotate slightly while anchored. Gestures occur only to emphasize key moments.\n\n[Action]: [0.0s-0.5s] [Simultaneous Cluster: Sharp Inhale + Eyes lock instantly to lens + Head is still (Pre-roll Buffer)]\n\n[0.5s-3.0s] [Simultaneous Cluster: [Hands in Active Idle (fingers interlocked, tight grip, thumbs pressing down)] + [Head tilts slightly right] + [Brows furrow slightly in seriousness]]\n\n[3.0s-6.0s] [Simultaneous Cluster: [Hands break clasp for a quick, contained open-palm rotation then return to base] + [Head drifts forward] + [Natural blink]]\n\n[6.0s-8.0s] [Simultaneous Cluster: [Hands return to Active Idle (loose clasp, thumbs tapping)] + [Head nods encouragingly] + [Cheeks lift in a natural smile]]\n\n[8.0s-10.0s] [Simultaneous Cluster: [Hands anchored (wrist shifts position)] + [Chin lifts in a quick, final nod] + [Natural blink]]\n\n[Script & Tonality]: (Tone: Urgent, Scarcity-driven, Serious) \"We only have 20 spots available because of our trainer capacity, and they fill up extremely fast.\" (Tone: Directive, Warm, Expectant) \"So click the button below, and I can't wait to see you in the gym.\" (Tone: Rapid, Final, Clean) \"and that is it for today.\"\n\n[Mood and Audio Pacing]: Rapid fire delivery, high energy, viral UGC style, confident, speaks fast the pacing [audio] should be at 2x speed\nNotice here in the prompt how I define the natural, subtle actions that the character should do at specific intervals throughout the video. \nPost-Production\nAt this point you've got all your clips generated.\nNow you wanna oad them into CapCut, put them all together and splice out any filler sentences or awkward pauses so it flows smoothly.\nNow there's two things I always do in post…\nFixing The Voice\nTo me the biggest telltale with AI is how shitty the voices sound.\nYeah people say use ElevenLab… but 11Labs sounds too studio-like.\nRemember just like with the images & videos… we don't want it sounding too nice. Because when you actually record yourself it's never that polished.\nOption 1: Adobe Podcast\nThis is the bare minimum. It's an audio cleaning tool & it does wonders.\nIf you've ever listened to raw Sora audio on mobile… it sounds terrible. But throw it through Adobe Podcast & it cleans that shit up so well it's insane.\nIt's super cheap and easy. Like I would do this at the absolute bare minimum.\nOption 2: Resemble AI (shoutout @Mho_23 for posting about this one)\nThis is a voice changer tool similar to Eleven Labs but it sounds way more natural in my opinion.\nIf you want to actually swap out the voice & make it sound legit… Resemble AI is what I'd recommend.\nCovering The Jump Cuts\nWhen you splice all these clips together you're going to have natural jump cuts. That's just how it is when you're stitching 8-10 second clips together.\nThe fix is simply is just use B-roll or animations over it\nOnce you have that in place & the pacing is smooth & the audio sounds legit…\nThe videos look so good & feel so realistic it's so sick.\nIf you want more AI sauce, sign up for my newsletter: https://tyler-vu.kit.com/main\nSide note there is also an AI tool called infinitetalk that people are using to make long form talking head AI videos\nMy only gripe against it is the pacing I don't have as much control over it as I do with the syllable method bc there's no timer with that tool at least of right now where I can say give me a 60s video... \nIt's more so like hey here's the image and the prompt and they just charge you credits by how long the video takes.

The composition is a medium-close portrait of a woman in her late 20s with blonde hair, sitting at a low wooden table on a traditional Japanese *engawa* (porch). She is wearing a blue and tan patterned yukata. Her skin texture is hyper-realistic: visible micro-pores on the nose, natural oils on the forehead, and slight \"laugh lines\" around the eyes. No studio lighting; the scene is lit by natural overcast daylight from the garden and soft shadows from the wooden pillars. In the foreground, an iPhone rests on the table showing the **Chatomo** app interface, next to a calligraphy brush and ink stone. The background shows a lush, slightly out-of-focus moss garden with a stone lantern. Minimal depth blur, slight lens smudge, and natural ISO grain to ensure it looks like a phone recording, not a render.\n\n---\n\n**Hand \"Home Base\" Protocol:**\nHands begin resting near the calligraphy paper. As she speaks, one hand moves to gesture toward the phone (the Chatomo app), while the other performs \"Active Idle\" (fingers twitching slightly or resting on the table edge). Gestures are sharp and energetic to match the \"forward\" personality.\n\n---\n\n**Action & Movement Cues (0.0s - 10.0s):**\n\n*   **[0.0s-0.5s]** [Simultaneous Cluster: Sharp, excited inhale + Wide-eyed \"hook\" expression + Head leans 10% closer to the lens.]\n*   **[0.5s-3.5s]** [Simultaneous Cluster: Left hand points energetically toward the phone on the table + Rapid head nod + Brows lift in an \"Aha!\" expression.]\n*   **[3.5s-6.5s]** [Simultaneous Cluster: Hands move into a \"counting\" gesture (holding up fingers) + Torso sways slightly side-to-side (natural spinal movement) + Frequent natural blinks.]\n*   **[6.5s-8.5s]** [Simultaneous Cluster: Hands return to table (\"Home Base\") + A broad, genuine smile showing natural teeth + Head tilts 15 degrees to the right in a friendly, inviting manner.]\n*   **[8.5s-10.0s]** [Simultaneous Cluster: Quick \"peace sign\" or wave gesture + Eyes lock back to lens + Final sharp nod of authority.]\n\n---\n\n**Script & Tonality (55-60 Syllable Chunk):**\n\n**Tone:** High-energy, infectious, rapid-fire, and encouraging.\n**Language:** Mix of English and Japanese (Teaching Moment).\n\n*(Script Chunking for Pacing):*\n\"Stop scrolling! Want to speak Japanese? Say: **'Nihongo ga suki desu!'** That means 'I love Japanese!' I learned that in two minutes on **Chatomo**. You literally build your own AI partner to talk to. It’s not a bot, it’s a vibe. Download Chatomo now and let’s speak! **Ganbatte!**\"\n\n---\n\n**Mood and Audio Pacing:**\n*   **Pacing:** Rapid-fire delivery, viral UGC style. Audio should be processed to sound like a high-quality phone microphone (use Adobe Podcast/Resemble AI to remove \"studio\" polish).\n*   **Energy:** 1.2x speed tonality. The voice should sound like a friend who is genuinely obsessed with the app.\n*   **Reality Details:** Include a subtle \"thud\" sound when her hand hits the table and the faint sound of wind/birds from the Japanese garden in the background to sell the environment.\n\n---\n\n**Post-Production Style Overlay:**\n*   **Visuals:** Raw UGC realism, available indoor/outdoor mixed light, slight lens flare from the garden.\n*   **Text Overlays:** Use \"TikTok style\" captions that pop up word-by-word in sync with the rapid-fire delivery. Highlight the Japanese words (**Nihongo / Ganbatte**) in a different color.",
